<h3>Using git & github</H3>
<pre>It is from git training course: git and GitHub for beginners from FreeCodeCamp start 
date: 11/17/2022</pre>

the extension of README.md stands for markdown

<p>
<H3>git commands:</H3>
<ul>
    <li><pre>init  : converts a directory into a new repository
            $ git init</pre></li>
    <li><pre>remote: Establish a connection between unconnected emote and local 
            repositories it is used when local and remote repositories are 
            created separately intead of being clones of one another
            $ git remote add master "git@github.com:example/remote-repository.git</pre></li>
    <li><pre>clone : brings a repository hosted online to local computer
            $ git clone github.com:elbiop/demo-repo.git</pre></li>
    <li><pre>status: gives information about untracked changes</pre></li>
    <li><pre>add   : begin to track a file in git that isn't being tracked
            $ git add filename.ext
            $ git add . # reack all files</pre></li>
    <li><pre>commit: save your files changes in git
            $ git commit -m "Reasosn for the changes or descriprion"</pre></li>
            if the files have only the status of <b><i>"Modified"</i></b> they can be added
            and commited in the same command:
                $git commit -am "message or comment"
    <li><pre>push  : upload changes to the remote repository
            $ git push origin "repository name"
                in order to avoid writing "origin master" a default upstream
                option ( -u is shorthand for --set-upsetream ) can be set
            $ git push -u origin master
                the subsequent pushes only "$ git push" will need to be written</pre></li>           
    <li><pre>pull  : download changes from remote repo to local machine</pre></li>
    <li><pre>gitignore: specifies which files should't be tracked</pre></li>
    <li><pre></pre></li>
</ul>
</p>

<H3>workflow</H3>
init -> add -> commit -> push ->pull
# Establishing connection with git-hub  
To establish comunination between GitHub and your local repository trugh git
you neeed to download git credential manager

<H3> branching</H3>
A branch is a tracking workflow preceding the main or "master" branch
The workflow is the same for each branch but no branch can see the changes done
to the other branches it is usefull for traking multiple teams working on about
single project.

<p>
<ul>
    <li><pre>branch : shows all branches including master</pre></li>
    <li><pre>checkout: creates a new branch or switch between branches
        $git checkout -b issue-1237-bugfix
            this line will create a branch (-b) named issue-1237-bugfix
        $git checkout main
            switches to "main" branch</pre></li>
    <li><pre>diff   : Shows the difference between child and mother branches
        beffore committing        
        $git diff issue-1237-bugfix
            in this case it shows the differences between this branch and "main"</pre></li>
    <li><pre></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>
<pre>*** Important: when typing the name of a branch you can hit the TAB key to 
autocomplete

Once you have PUSHED a branch it will appear in GitHub then you need to compare
using the <b><i>COMPARE AND PULL REQUEST</i></b> button on the left. Then list alll the
changes made in the <b><i>LEAVE A COMMENT</i></b> section.
then click <b><i>CREATE PULL REQUEST</i></b> to merge the branch into it's parent.

You can comment the code using the <b><i>FILES</i></b> tab, and this will create the
option for resolving issues and making aclarandums by initiating a conversation.

if someone has initated a conversation using comments you might have to resolve
the conversation before the you kill the branch by pressing <b><i>MERGE PULL REQUEST</i></b>

The final step is to make a <b><i>$git pull origin master</i></b> to update your local
repository.

to delete a branch type: <strong><i>$git branch -d "branch name"</i></strong>

<h3>Merge conflicts</h3>
When the same file is being edited by multiple branches or people GitHub will
detect a conflict, since it can't decide which update to accept then a manual
conflict resolution has to be performed.
