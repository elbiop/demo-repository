<h1>Using git & github</H2>
<pre>It is from git training course: git and GitHub for beginners from FreeCodeCamp start 
date: 11/17/2022</pre>

the extension of README.md stands for markdown

<p>
<H3>Basic git commands:</H3>
<ul>
    <li><pre><b>init  :</b> converts a directory into a new repository
    <b>$ git init</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>remote:</b> Establish a connection between unconnected remote and local 
        repositories it is used when local and remote repositories are 
        created separately instead of being clones of one another
    <b>$ git remote add master "git@github.com:example/remote-repository.git</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>clone :</b> brings a repository hosted online to local computer
    <b>$ git clone github.com:eexamplelbiop/repository.git</b> 
    creates locally a copy of a remote repository and tracks it</pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>add   :</b> begin to track a file in git that isn't being tracked
    <b>$ git add filename.ext</b>
    <b>$ git add .,/b> Track all files</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>commit:</b> save your files changes in git
    <b>$ git commit -m "Reasons for the changes or description"</b>
        if the files have only the status of <b><i>"Modified"</i></b> they can be added
        and committed in the same command:
    <b>$git commit -am "message or comment"</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>push  :</b> upload changes to the remote repository
    <b>$ git push origin "repository name"</b>
        in order to avoid writing "origin master" a default upstream
        option ( -u is shorthand for --set-upstream ) can be set
    <b>$ git push -u origin master</b>
        the subsequent pushes only "$ git push" will need to be written</pre></li>           
    <li><pre><b>pull  :</b> download changes from remote repo to local machine</pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>rm :</b> removes files and directories from git tracking.
    <b>$git rm "filename"</b> untrack single file
    <b>$git rm -r "directory"</b>untracks an entire directory
        ***warning it does not delete the files, only will disappear from the
    	remote viewing and editing of the repository***</pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>gitignore:</b> specifies which files should't be tracked</pre></li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4>workflow</H4>
init -> add -> commit -> push ->pull
<h4>GitHub connection</h4>
<pre>
To establish comunincation between GitHub and your local repository through git
you need to download git credential manager
</pre>
<u><H3>** Branching **</H3></u>
<pre>A branch is a tracking workflow preceding the main or "master" branch
The workflow is the same for each branch but no branch can see the changes done
to the other branches it is useful for tracking multiple teams working on about
single project.
</pre>
<pre>
branches should be as brief as possible since the <b>MERGING</b> process can and
will generate conflicts that have to be manually resolved.
</pre>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><pre><b>branch :</b> command for creating and managing branches
    <b>$git branch "branch-name"</b>
        creates a branch
    <b>$git branch --list</b>
        shows all local branches including master.
    <b>git branch -a</b>
        list all local and remote branches
    <b>$git branch -d "branch name"</b>
        deletes the branch.
    <b>$git branch -D </b>
        Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes.
        This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all
        of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
    <b>$git branch -m "new branch name"</b>
        Rename the current branch .</pre></li>   
    <li><pre><b>checkout:</b> creates a new branch or switch between branches
    <b>$git checkout -b "branch name"</b>
        this line will create a branch
    <b>$git checkout main</b>
        switches to "main" branch</pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>diff   :</b> Shows the difference between child and mother branches
        before committing        
    <b>$git diff "branch name"</b>
        in this case it shows the differences between this branch and "main"</pre></li>
    <li><pre><b>merge :</b> merges a branch to the parent.
    <b>$git merge "master"</b> merges the current branch to the "master" branch.
</ul>
<p>
<pre>*** Important: when typing the name of a branch you can hit the TAB key to 
autocomplete

</pre>
<h4>Merging a branch in Github</h4>
<pre>
Once you have PUSHED a branch it will appear in GitHub then you need to compare
using the <b><i>COMPARE AND PULL REQUEST</i></b> button on the left. Then list all the
changes made in the <b><i>LEAVE A COMMENT</i></b> section.
then click <b><i>CREATE PULL REQUEST</i></b> to merge the branch into it's parent.

You can comment the code using the <b><i>FILES</i></b> tab, and this will create the
option for resolving issues and adding explanations by initiating a conversation.

if someone has initiated a conversation using comments you might have to resolve
the conversation before the you kill the branch by pressing <b><i>MERGE PULL REQUEST</i></b>

The final step is to make a <b><i>$git pull origin master</i></b> to update your local
repository.

Finally you can delete a branch once the branch is merged using the button
<b><i>DELETE BRANCH</i></b>

<h4>Merge conflicts</h4>

When the same file is being edited by multiple branches or people GitHub will
detect a conflict, since it can't decide which update to accept then a manual
conflict resolution has to be performed.
</pre>
<h4>Merging a branch in bash terminal</h4>
<pre>After commiting a branch in the terminal NO NOT PUSH to GitHub, instead 
checkout to the "Main" branch.
$git merge "branch-name" then resolve the conflicts if any.
$git branch -d "branch-name" deletes the branch once it is fully merged.</pre>
</p>
<h3>Unstaging and Undoing</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><pre><b>reset :</b>Unstages or reverse aditions/commits when Some unwanted changes 
    have ocurred
    <b>$git reset "**pointer**"</b>
        Reverse any commits staged after the "**pointer**" this pointer is the hash
        number for that commit and can be found using <b> $git log </b>. A special
        pointer is the word "HEAD" which points to the last commit submitted
        </li></pre>
</ul>
